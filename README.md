## Frontend developer eager to learn and develop!! 💪

I am a frontend developer with an ambition to become a fullstack developer. My coding journey started over a year ago when I decided to build a webpage for an event I was organizing. After doing couple of hobby projects, I got hooked on programming with JS, quit my job and started a intensive bootcamp to learn coding professionally. I love coding because it allows me to work with solving problems and I can learn new things all the time! I love working in a team and am used to being a part of a multicultural work environment.
